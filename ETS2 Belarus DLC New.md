A question about the upcoming Euro Truck Simulator 2: Belarus DLC!

As of now, there is no official release date announced for the Belarus DLC. However, SCS Software, the developers of Euro Truck Simulator 2, have confirmed that the Belarus DLC is in development and will be released at some point in the future.

SCS Software typically doesn't announce exact release dates for their DLCs until they are closer to completion. However, they do share updates and teasers about upcoming DLCs on their social media channels and forums.

If you want to stay up-to-date with the latest news and information about the Belarus DLC, I recommend following SCS Software's official social media channels and forums:

Facebook: @EuroTruckSimulator
Twitter: @SCSsoft
YouTube: SCS Software
Forum: SCS Software Forums
Keep an eye on these channels, and you'll likely get notified when the Belarus DLC is announced or released.

In the meantime, you can keep enjoying the existing DLCs and features in Euro Truck Simulator 2.
